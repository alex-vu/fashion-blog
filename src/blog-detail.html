              <p>
                The impact of health on personal productivity is already widely
                known. Efforts to maintain health are essential for high
                performance business people. However, the “health” aspect that
                companies reflect in the system is often limited to physical
                health only.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only in terms of physical health, but also in terms of
                mentality, the dining team at CRAZY CO. , LTD. With health at
                the top of management priorities, we devise daily meals and
                communications for that purpose. Wishing the health of our
                employees, team leader Sawako Kimura said, the role of a dining
                team that is not just corporate food.

              <p>
                The dining team prepares meals and snacks for employees daily in
                the kitchen at the office. It is a so-called company food of
                welfare program. All ingredients used are delivered by the
                dining team, choosing only the ones that you trust to touch and
                touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal is not just to eat, but to "get more people who can be
                healthy on their own". To that end, we are conscious of “a place
                that creates organic communication” that supports mental health.

              <p>
                I agree. In addition, talking with the producer made me more
                aware of the “beginning of life” and “connection”. We are
                usually in the city and forget that we are in the city of
                concrete, but we live in harmony with rich nature and animals.
                There is soil, and there are plants growing well there, and the
                trees have a very rich harvest. When it comes to the sea, there
                are many types of fish swimming.
              </p>
              <p>
                People tend to think of being at the top of a pyramid-shaped
                ecosystem, but we are in the flow of life that starts from the
                earth and the sea. I became more aware of such “the beginning of
                life” and “connection”.
              </p>
              <p>
                We, the dining team, receive life from producers who grow and
                distribute plants and animals, prepare them to eat more
                deliciously, and deliver them to employees. So you are the one
                who connects the baton of life. I do not want to forget that,
                and I would like to convey it properly.

                ― Please tell us about your future prospects and goals.
              </div>
              <p>
                The immediate goal is to deepen the motivation and awareness of
                individual employee health as a dining team. For this purpose,
                we are currently considering an initiative to bring home-made
                side dishes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, suppose that there is a person who thinks "I should
                eat cup ramen properly at night". If you have one CRAZY dining
                side dish, you may be thinking of preparing only the rice and
                miso soup yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                From that point on, I would like to be able to support the
                concept of “health” more broadly and to be a team that can fully
                support exercise, sleep, and human relationships to ensure
                psychological safety.
              </p>
              <figure class="blog-images">
                <img src="images/thumb-1.jpeg" alt="" />
              </figure>
              <p>
                However, the basis for the dining team to keep in mind is what I
                think or "prayer". We strongly sympathize with the ideal that
                our employees are trying to give, so we can not release the
                "health" that we tend to lose in the process. It is impossible
                to get in the body of all the employees and cure the bad place,
                or to put a hand to cure it, but it is not good to put "prayer"
                in the dish saying "I hope you get well by eating this". Because
                you can.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, I think that productivity as a business is important.
                However, I think that I would like to continue to deliver a
                moment when I feel "delicious" honestly, and a rich lunch with
                friends who can share that feeling.
